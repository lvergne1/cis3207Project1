The program was tested using many different values for the config file.  First, the biggest problem was having little to go on.  As such the first value to be set was cpuMin and cpuMax, and the rest of the values were chosen from this.  The problem that is encountered is that as jobs enter the system values needed to be chosen in such a way that the queue sizes remained reasonably stable under the new events.  As such, trial and error was used (with the benefit of the statistics file) in order to select a job arrival time which seemed reasonable, and as a result, a definition for reasonable could be deduced.
A reasonable job arrival time is one in which jobs arrive frequently enough that the CPU idle time is minimized, however, they must be far enough apart so that the program does not begin to grow indefinitely as new events enter the system.
